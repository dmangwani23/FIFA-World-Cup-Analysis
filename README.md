# FIFA-World-Cup-Analysis
I had never coded before, and I took an Intro to Python course whilst pursuing my MBA. We were allowed to choose a project that we were passionate about, and so I chose the FIFA World Cup, since I've always been a massive fan of the sport, and to be able to do an analysis on the history of the World Cup would be a fun experience.
